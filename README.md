# Extracting GPS Information from Smartphone Photos

This repository demonstrates how to extract GPS information from smartphone photos and plot it in an interactive `.html` file. Also, we generate a `.csv` file, allowing to open this coordinate in different GIS/Softwares.

## Why Extract GPS Coordinates?

While your phone can show you where a photo was taken, there are several reasons you might want to extract GPS coordinates:

- **Fieldwork Documentation:** If you're conducting fieldwork and need to review where each picture was taken, extracting coordinates allows you to plot all locations on a map for easy visualization.
- **Blogging and Storytelling:** Enhance your travel blog by showcasing the exact spots where you captured stunning photos, such as sunsets or scenic views.


## Getting Started

The steps to extract and visualize GPS coordinates are straightforward and detailed in [this notebook](reading_photos.ipynb). All the `requirements` are in this [file](requirements.txt).
